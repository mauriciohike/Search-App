# Github User Search App

The purpose of this app is to retrieve informations of Github's users and show them in a good looking page.

## Getting Started
I created with vue-cli, so to run the app, need to run these commands:

    yarn install
    yarn serve

Then access the port **localhost:8080/**
    

## Tech/framework used

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) with [ES6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

Was wondering of which Front-End Framework/Lib to use. I opted by **Vue** for the **simplicity**, easy **componentization** and the simplest implementation of **Flux** (in my opinion).



## Design

All the screens were made to be very simple, with focus on the objective of the app.

### Color Palette

    F26722 -> Primary
    FDFAF8 -> Background / Light Support
    040408 -> Text / Dark Support
    D4C2B6 -> Borders / Medium Support
